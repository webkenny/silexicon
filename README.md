# Silexicon
This application looks up English words from a MySQL dictionary. 

## What is this?
This is an example application for a simple English Dictionary REST API. I have created this to practice and (someday) teach the following concepts:

- Silex
- Symfony2 Components
- Building Microservices
- Design Patterns in OOP
- HATEOAS
- Documenting a REST API
- TDD/BDD
 
## What can I use this for?
I encourage you to fork, learn from, or otherwise abuse this code in any way you see fit. I ask, however, that you follow the respective licenses of the open source software contained within. 

## Documentation
A fully documented REST API will be provided once the code is stable.

## Installation
Coming soon but, for now, I would expect to use [Composer](http://getcomposer.org) to download project dependencies.

## Credits
This is based on the excellent [Silex](http://silex.sensiolabs.org) microframework which is, in turn, based on a few excellent [Symfony2](http://symfony.com/components) components. I've also used the [MySQL English Dictionary](http://sourceforge.net/projects/mysqlenglishdictionary/) from sourceforge.net to provide the data.
